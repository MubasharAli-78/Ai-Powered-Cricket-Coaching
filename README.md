# AI-Powered Gesture-Based Cricket Coaching System

**A next-generation cricket coaching platform that leverages computer vision and deep learning to provide real-time posture tracking, gesture recognition, angle analysis, and in-depth performance analytics ‚Äî all with instant feedback to elevate players‚Äô skills.**

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**  
  Detects batting and bowling postures using advanced deep-learning models (e.g., YOLOv8, MediaPipe) to identify key gestures and movements on the fly.

- **Angle Calculation & Biomechanical Analysis**  
  Computes joint and bat-angle metrics (e.g., elbow flexion, shoulder alignment) to ensure optimal technique and prevent injury.

- **Instant Feedback & Coaching Tips**  
  Provides visual and textual feedback during practice sessions, highlighting posture deviations and suggesting corrective drills.

- **Session Recording & Review**  
  Records every training session in high-resolution video, annotated with overlayed skeletons and key performance metrics for post-practice analysis.

- **Comprehensive Performance Dashboard**  
  Aggregates session data into graphs and tables to track progress over time, compare against benchmarks, and set personalized goals.

## üéØ Main Objectives

1. **Enhance Coaching Efficiency**  
   Automate posture and gesture analysis so coaches can focus on personalized training strategies rather than manual video review.

2. **Improve Player Technique**  
   Use quantitative angle measurements and biomechanical comparisons to fine-tune batting and bowling form.

3. **Data-Driven Progress Tracking**  
   Enable both coaches and players to visualize improvements and identify areas needing attention through detailed analytics.
